# infection-sim

Simulating the Spread of an Infectious Disease in a Small Community

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment for the project to be run in (python virtual environment in pycharm may not work - best to use an anaconda virtual environment)
3. Run the following command on the directory of the project to install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the following command on the directory of the project to start the project
```
mesa runserver
```

## Notes
1. It may take awhile to launch the project while it creates the agent database from census data
2. There is a how_to_run.pdf that shows the specific IDEs and steps that we personally used to run
